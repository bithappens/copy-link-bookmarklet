# [Copy Current Page Link Bookmarklet](https://bithappens.github.io/copy-link-bookmarklet)

Do you keep notes or write somewhere about the websites that you are visiting?
Then these bookmarklets are for you!
With just a single click, you copy a link to the current page featuring the title of the page in various formats (e.g. rich text, Markdown, html, wikitext, latex, reStructuredText)
Furthermore, the copied links will be cleaned to remove the most common tracking IDs.
