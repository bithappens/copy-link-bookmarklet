# [Copy Current Page Link Bookmarklet](TODO: Link to main webpage)

> Bookmarklets for copying a link to the currently open page in various formats.

Do you keep notes or write somewhere about the websites that you are visiting?
Then this bookmarklet is for you!
With a single click, you copy a formatted link to the current page featuring the title of the page in various formats (e.g. formated text, Markdown, html, wikitext, latex, reStructuredText)
Furthermore, the copied links will be cleaned to remove the most common tracking IDs.
